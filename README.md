# Battleship Game

## Rules

Each player has 10 ships somewhere on their field.  The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally.   Ships may not overlap with each other.  No ships may be placed on another ship. 

Player's take turns to guess by entering out the coordinates. The opponent responds with "shoot" or "miss" as appropriate. For example, if you enter out F6 and your opponent does not have any ship located at F6, your opponent would respond with "miss". 

As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.
